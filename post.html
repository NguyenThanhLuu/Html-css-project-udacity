            <h1>Binh Dinh thorny leaves cake</h1>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                    Binh Dinh is a coastal province in central Vietnam, where it not
                    only has many beautiful scenes such as Eo Gio, Xanh Isle, Ky Co
                    beach, Quy Nhon beach, etc., but also gathers the most attractive
                    dishes. In particular, the country has a specialty and traditional
                    cake that many people probably know about. That is Binh Dinh hemp
                    leaf cake. What does this kind of cake with few hemp leaves have
                    that always cause nostalgia for diners, go with me to find out.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="image-modify">
                    <img class="img-item" src="./imgs/Binh-dinh-hemp-leaf-cake-one.jpg"
                        alt="Binh Dinh hemp leaf picture one" class="illustrate-image" />
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The cake's crust is made of the main ingredient of heart-shaped,
                    rough, spongy spines to have a dark green color and acrid flavor for
                    the cake. The baker removed the petiole, leaf veins, torn the
                    prickly leaves into small pieces by hand, washed, then boiled. Then
                    put all the hemp leaves and glutinous rice into the mortar and pound
                    it very finely so that the two blends are no longer squishy, ​​so
                    flexible to make the typical flavor of little gai leaf cake.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The cake artisans said that the process of pounding the leaves is
                    very important, so pounding by hand for a long time instead of by
                    machine, pounding like this, the dough is smooth and chewy and
                    delicious. Because if you have not pounded the flour and pureed the
                    leaves of the thorns, the cake will be eaten, creating a feeling of
                    not being delicious.
                </p>
                <br>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Just like the crust of the cake, it is very necessary to be equally
                    skillful because it is the soul of the cake with few prickly leaves.
                    There are two main ingredients for the filling: grated coconut and
                    green beans. First, you take the copra meat into small fibers. Then
                    you prepare the green beans with large, firm seeds. Here comes the
                    part to create the cake.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Pour shredded coconut into the slug pan with white granulated sugar,
                    add a little ginger, slug until just dry. As for green beans, after
                    soaking for a few hours, they are soft, when cooked, pound them
                    finely, then sweeten with sugar and ginger. When finished, mix green
                    beans, grated coconut and roll into small balls to receive into the
                    cake shell. In particular, adding ginger to the cake will create a
                    very unique flavor that matches the taste of Binh Dinh thorn-leaf
                    cake.
